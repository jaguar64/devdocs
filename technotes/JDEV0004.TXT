Re:   New EEPROM sources



Please be aware that there were some recent changes to the EEPROM sources. 

Several routines in EEPROM.S had a bug where the return value was accidentally
being trashed by a register save/restore.  This has been fixed.

The fixed sources are in the latest version of SOURCE.ZIP which was posted
online in early/mid April.  Please make sure you download it if you haven't
already.

Remember that the online file ROADMAP.TXT serves as a guide to what is contained
in the Jaguar Developer Kit archive files distributed online on Compuserve and
the Atari Software Development BBS.  If you want to know what's new and improved,
take a look at ROADMAP.TXT.
